Welcome, this is a collection of all 340 python scripts I did while on college 6 years ago.

it has a bunch of cool stuff and a bunch on uselees things too.

the best ones are inside the folders "imagem" and "maths". some need to be reworked, I used to have 5 custom libraries saved inside my python/libs folder and now it is lost to time :v but iirc they are simple text operations, file manipulations (getting images), and more automatic user input validation.

[Camila Reis 27/01/2026] - Started reworking some of the scripts to make them functional again. Will try to update this readme as I go. my objective is to clean up all the mypy, pylance and ruff warnings and errors. it started with 18567 errors.

[Camila Reis 05/02/2026] - got the errors down to 11818, still a long way to go. I am putting this reworking on hold for now, will come back to it later. I am only doing this because my newest project is about collatz conjecture and my old scripts have some collatz implementations. but then the project got way bigger than I expected so I had to stop reworking these scripts to focus on that.
