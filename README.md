Welcome, this is a collection of all 340 python scripts I did while on college 6 years ago.

it has a bunch of cool stuff and a bunch on uselees things too.

the best ones are inside the folders "imagem" and "maths". some need to be reworked, I used to have 5 custom libraries saved inside my python/libs folder and now it is lost to time :v but iirc they are simple text operations, file manipulations (getting images), and more automatic user input validation.
